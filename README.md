# Real-Time Hand Gesture Controlled Media Player on Jetson Nano

An edge-AI based real-time gesture recognition system that enables touchless media control using NVIDIA Jetson Nano.

The system detects hand landmarks using MediaPipe, extracts normalized features, classifies gestures using a trained ML model (Random Forest / MLP), and controls media playback via MPV using IPC socket communication.

# Project Overview

This project demonstrates a complete edge AI pipeline:

Camera Input → MediaPipe Landmark Extraction → Feature Normalization → ML Classification → Media Player Control

The model is trained offline on a laptop and deployed on Jetson Nano for real-time inference.

The system operates fully offline and does not require internet connectivity.

# Dataset Collection

Dataset is collected manually using MediaPipe hand landmarks.

Each sample contains:

- 21 hand landmarks
- (x, y, z) coordinates
- Wrist-relative normalization
- Scale normalization using hand size
- Gesture label
- User ID

Total Features per sample:
21 landmarks × 3 coordinates = 63 features

Dataset stored as: gesture_dataset_cleaned.csv

# Model Training

Training is performed offline on laptop for computational efficiency.

### Models Used:

- Random Forest Classifier
- Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)

### Training Pipeline:

1. Load dataset
2. Remove unnecessary columns
3. Split into train/test sets
4. Apply scaling (for MLP)
5. Train model
6. Evaluate accuracy
7. Save model using joblib

### Example:

```bash
python train_model_jetson.py
